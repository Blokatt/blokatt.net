*[Blokatt]: 2013-2021
*[Kešu]: Posílám pozdravy Velkýmu Chytrákovi.
*[(?)]: Voříšek, technically. Not that I'm gonna ask you to type that, let alone pronounce it.
*[C/C++]: Pretty much used on a daily basis. Rust coming soon™.
*[GLSL/HLSL/Cg]: Yep, always fun.
*[Python/Perl/Bash]: The occasional scripting, you know the drill.
*[Processing/Java]: Fun for immediate mode-like graphics prototyping and the occasional sketch, I suppose. Pretends not to be Java, but totally is. 
*[PICO-8/Lua]: Yeah, that's still a thing.
*[GML]: Made games with this one for years. These days, not so much. 
*[C#]: Good WinForms memories and the occasional Unity doodling.
*[JSFX]: I like pretending to know how to write VSTs.
*[front-end web stuff]: You're looking at it, make your own judgement.

Also, my old Tumblr site can be found [here](https://me.blokatt.net/){:target="_blank"}, if you're looking for it for whatever reason (which you probably aren't).

Even less likely is the possibilty of you searching for my [first site from 2013](http://old.blokatt.net/){:target="_blank"}.
