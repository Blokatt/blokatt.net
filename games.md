description: Things I've put together that resemble video games.
---
Since 2019, I've been putting my gamedev skills to work at [SCS Software](https://scssoft.com/) as a junior programmer.
Here are a few games that I've put togehter before that, mostly for game jams. **Quality may vary.** Some of my best work sadly still remains unreleased to this day. I plan on returning to solo gamedev eventually, though.

I have also collaborated on a number of games as sound and/or music person, more on that [in the audio section](/audio/).

You can also find me on [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/@Blokatt) and [itch.io](https://blokatt.itch.io/).
