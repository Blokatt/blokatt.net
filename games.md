I'm currently taking a hiatus from solo gamedev (after 10+ years) due to general burnout and to work on my other skills.   
Here are a few games I've made, mostly for game jams. **Quality may vary.** Some of my best work sadly still remains unreleased to this day.

I have also collaborated on a number of games as sound and/or music person, more on that [in the audio section](/audio/).

You can also find me on [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/@Blokatt) and [itch.io](https://blokatt.itch.io/).
