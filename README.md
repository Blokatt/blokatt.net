My personal website, made in Jekyll. Still in the process of cleaning this up.

The **tools** folder contains useful scripts used to convert/generate galleries, thumbnails and general video assets.

Powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Uses a modified version of the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme.

- Header visual powered by [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
- Font used on the website is [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) by Raph Levien.
- Icons by [Line Awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome).
- Additional Jekyll scripts by [J.H. van der Schee](https://jekyllcodex.org/).
- Video and image asset processing made possible with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/){:target="_blank"}, [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) and [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/).
