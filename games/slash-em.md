Another gm(48) entry, this one won 3rd place [(trophy)](https://i.imgur.com/AuQgXUo.png)!   
In _[Netslash]_, you play as member of an IRC chat, whose goal is to drive all users off selected channels whilst avoiding the ban hammer.   
I think I was going through a weird phase when I made this.

There's actually a slightly better version of this (screenshots below) sitting on my hard drive, maybe one day I'll get around to releasing it.
