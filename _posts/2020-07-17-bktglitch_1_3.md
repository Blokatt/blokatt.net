<div class="subsection">
Hello. I've basically done a complete rewrite of [bktGlitch](https://blokatt.net/gfx/bktglitch/), hopefully improving performance and compatibility in the process.   
It's also free now, so I don't feel obligated to respond to emails.    
That is all. Sorry it took three years. Enjoy.
