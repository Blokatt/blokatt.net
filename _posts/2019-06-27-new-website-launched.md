Welcome, everyone!   
After several months of work, I am happy to finally
present to you my brand new website!

More than 4 years after the launch of its [2nd version](https://me.blokatt.net), I figured it was time to finally ditch Tumblr and switch to something more professional. Following a fair amount of research, I chose the static site generator known as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the task, as it allowed me complete freedom while also taking care of _almost_ all of the boring stuff at the same time. The theme you see is a heavily modified version of the wonderful [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) because sidebars rock if you keep them responsive. Whether or not hundreds of lines of my questionable CSS made it better or worse is up to you to decide. I, personally, am satisfied with the result.

I believe this fresh format will let me share the various types of my work in the most efficient and prettiest way possible (to date, at least) - even without a CMS, thanks to Jekyll (seriously, check it out guys, it's great). Oh, and I can post properly formatted written content now, which is definitely a plus. Maybe I'll finally get around to typing up a few tutorials and post-mortems.

To make this all possible, I also had to solve a number of issues related to automatic conversion of media assets, gallery generation, image captioning, etc. The resulting _extremely_ fine-tuned Bash scripts (yes, really), as well as a more detailed technical write-up should be available in a week or so.

Of course, some content might still be missing and the CSS gets wonky here and there, but all
of these issues and more will hopefully get ironed out in the near future as I gather feedback.

I'm still on the fence when it comes to enabling Disqus comments, but I'll be more than happy to
hear your thoughts on the redesign on Twitter or via email.  


Let me know what you think!
