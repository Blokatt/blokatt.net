An ASCII-art piece made in Processing using a custom shader, as well as my first attempt at modelling something more complex in Blender. The font used to generate the gradient texture is [Perfect DOS VGA 437](https://www.dafont.com/perfect-dos-vga-437.font).

This one was a real success on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/perfectloops/comments/905hxl/its_terminal_aoc/) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/jStRunJ).
