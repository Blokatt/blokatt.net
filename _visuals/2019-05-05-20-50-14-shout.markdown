A looping animation produced for musician/visual artist [Graham Kartna](https://twitter.com/GrahamKartna). Included in various materials related to his May 2019 album ['These Are The Shout'](https://grahamkartna.bandcamp.com/album/these-are-the-shout). Blender was used to both model the scene and generate its lighting. The rendering was taken care of by Processing using a version of my [water shader](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}/status/1105948069588287488).

I highly recommend you [check the album out on Bandcamp](https://grahamkartna.bandcamp.com/album/these-are-the-shout), it's pretty sweet!   
More of Graham's music can be heard on [his Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/grahamkartna)!
