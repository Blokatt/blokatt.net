This (still unnamed) application is going to provide graphics programmers with an easy way to visualise simple and complex [kernel-based image filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)), with the option to export them as either single-pass or multi-pass GLSL shaders. It's being built in Qt, with OpenGL used for rendering. More info soon!
